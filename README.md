Firezone is a self-hosted VPN server and Linux firewall. This role helps you to set up
firezone:

- with everything run in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers
- powered by [the official Firezone container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dxflrs/garage)


## Installing

To configure and install Firezone on your own server(s), you should use a playbook like [Mother of all self-hosting](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).
